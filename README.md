# dnd-avrae
## Instructions:

The scripts are separated by commented lines; read the comments as they will offer information on the code block that follows. To import a code block that is less that 2000 chars, just copy the entire thing and paste it into discord chat. You can then access the alias by the alias name listed at the beginning of the code block:

This is the rage alias for example:

!alias rage embed

To use it you would do this in discord:

!rage

For code blocks that are more than 2000 chars, you will have to import it in the avrae dashboard:

https://avrae.io/dashboard/aliases

When importing in this fashion, start the copy at the word embed, omit the "!alias [name]" portion of alias code blocks. For example, in the rage alias line listed above "!alias rage" would be omitted, you would start copying at embed.
